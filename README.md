# Future Work

1. The API only allows making 5 calls/hour for free users, a better API service will better the application
2. Test for all kinds of different sizes of screens, for checking consistent designs
3. Currently it only works for Android, making it available for iOS phones using XCode
4. Create a user database with login/logout feature
